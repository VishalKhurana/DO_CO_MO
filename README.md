DO_CO_MO - Doctor Compounder Medical Store Interaction System

# Description
This software aims to ease the process of patient medical file in the hospital.I have created a pipleine architecture where the patient  first register himself giving his basic details.
After giving details,the patient will be allocated a token number.When his turn will come,his details will be fetched from the database at the doctor's end (which is one of the client)
in the form of precription sheet where he can add the medicines,tests,etc.Once the doctor is done with the assigned patient,his details will be fetched by the medical store person who
will get the medicines ready beforehand and generate the bill.

# To run:
